Ulysses
=======

A reliable digital text of James Joyce's novel Ulysses, with error corrections, regex replacements, and HTML/CSS for important typographical choices added by Amanda Visconti. Built off the plaintext transcription of the 1922 first printing of Ulysses by Matthew Kochis and Patrick Belk with the Modernist Versions Project (http://web.uvic.ca/~mvp1922/).

These files are suitable for use on websites; for example, you can drop any of these files into a Drupal page and have it look like the print page in the 1922 Ulysses. I've been using a spreadsheet to bulk import pages to Drupal; will share that here as well in the future.
