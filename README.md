Ulysses
=======
This repo contains a reliable digital text of James Joyce's novel *Ulysses*. Built off the plaintext transcription of the 1922 first printing of Ulysses by **Matthew Kochis** and **Patrick Belk** with the **[Modernist Versions Project] (http://web.uvic.ca/~mvp1922/)**, **Amanda Visconti** has added transcription-error corrections, regex formatting replacements, and HTML/CSS for important typographical choices used in the 1922 first printing of the novel (as verified against the Modernist Versions Project's digital images of the printing). This is the text used in the **[InfiniteUlysses.com](http://www.InfiniteUlysses.com)** digital edition of *Ulysses*.
