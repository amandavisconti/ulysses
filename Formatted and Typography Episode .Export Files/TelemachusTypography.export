Buck Mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly. Then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said :<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— The bard's noserag. A new art colour for our Irish poets : snotgreen. You can almost taste it, can't you ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He mounted to the parapet again and gazed out over Dublin bay, his fair oakpale hair stirring slightly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— God, he said quietly. Isn't the sea what Algy calls it: a great sweet mother? The snotgreen sea. The scrotumtightening sea. <em>Epi oinopa ponton</em>. Ah, Dedalus, the Greeks. I must teach you. You must read them in the original. <em>Thalalta! Thalatta!</em> She is our great sweet mother. Come and look.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. Leaning on it he looked down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbour mouth of Kingstown.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Our mighty mother, Buck Mulligan said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned abruptly his great searching eyes from the sea to Stephen's face.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— The aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. That's why she won't let me have anything to do with you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Someone killed her, Stephen said gloomily.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— You could have knelt down, damn it, Kinch, when your dying mother asked you, Buck Mulligan said. I'm hyperborean as much as you. But to think of your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for her. And you refused. There is something sinister in you...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He broke off and lathered again lightly his farther cheek. A tolerant smile curled his lips.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— But a lovely mummer, he murmured to himself.

Is it some paradox?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. It's quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet's grandson is Shakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loose laughter, said to Stephen's ear:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— We're always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is rather long to tell.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. <em>That beetles o'er his base into the sea</em>, isn't it?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— It's a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent. The seas' ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat, vague on the bright skyline, and a sail tacking by the Muglins.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused. The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a doll's head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:<div class=\"centering\">— I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.<br>My mother's a jew, my father's a bird.<br>With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree,<br>So here's to disciples and Calvary.</div>",

Is it some paradox?<br />     — Pooh! Buck Mulligan said. We have grown out of Wilde and paradoxes. It's quite simple. He proves by algebra that Hamlet's grandson is Shakespeare's grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own father.<br />     — What? Haines said, beginning to point at Stephen. He himself?<br />     Buck Mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in<br />     loose laughter, said to Stephen's ear:<br />     — O, shade of Kinch the elder! Japhet in search of a father!<br />     — We're always tired in the morning, Stephen said to Haines. And it is rather long to tell.<br />     Buck Mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.<br />     — The sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of Dedalus, he said.<br />     — I mean to say, Haines explained to Stephen as they followed, this tower and these cliffs here remind me somehow of Elsinore. <em>That beetles o'er his base into the sea</em>, isn't it?<br />     Buck Mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards Stephen but did not speak. In the bright silent instant Stephen saw his own image in cheap dusty mourning between their gay attires.<br />     — It's a wonderful tale, Haines said, bringing them to halt again.<br />     Eyes, pale as the sea the wind had freshened, paler, firm and prudent. The seas' ruler, he gazed southward over the bay, empty save for the smokeplume of the mailboat, vague on the bright skyline, and a sail tacking by the Muglins.<br />     — I read a theological interpretation of it somewhere, he said bemused. The Father and the Son idea. The Son striving to be atoned with the Father.<br />     Buck Mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. He looked at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had suddenly withrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. He moved a doll's head to and fro, the brims of his Panama hat quivering, and began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:<br /></p><div class=\"centering\">— I'm the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.<br />My mother's a jew, my father's a bird.<br />With Joseph the joiner I cannot agree,<br />So here's to disciples and Calvary.</div>\n",

You wouldn't kneel down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. Why? Because you have the cursed jesuit strain in you, only it's injected the wrong way. To me it's all a mockery and beastly. Her cerebral lobes are not functioning. She calls the doctor Sir Peter Teazle and picks buttercups off the quilt. Humour her till it's over. You crossed her last wish in death and yet you sulk with me because I don't whinge like some hired mute from Lalouette's. Absurd! I suppose I did say it. I didn't mean to offend the memory of your mother.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had spoken himself into boldness.
