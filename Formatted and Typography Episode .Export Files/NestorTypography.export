You have two copies there. If you can have them published at once.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Telegraph. Irish Homestead.</em><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— I will try, Stephen said, and let you know tomorrow. I know two editors slightly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field, M. P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at the City Arms Hotel. I asked him to lay my letter before the meeting. You see if you can get it into your two papers. What are they?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— <em>The Evening Telegraph</em>...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— That will do, Mr Deasy said. There is no time to lose. Now I have to answer that letter from my cousin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Good morningr sir, Stephen said, putting the sheets in his pocket. Thank you<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Not at all, Mr Deasy said as he searched the papers on his desk.

I know two editors slightly.<br />     — That will do, Mr Deasy said briskly. I wrote last night to Mr Field, M. P. There is a meeting of the cattletraders' association today at the City Arms Hotel.
