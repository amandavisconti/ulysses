619,619,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford Place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west : then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner’s place by an inadvertence as far as the farther corner of Temple street, north : then, at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George’s church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glowlamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen’s collapse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religions, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism."
620,620,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were their views on some points divergent ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen dissented openly from Bloom’s views on the importance of dietary and civic selfhelp while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen’s views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assently covertly to Stephen’s rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to Christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac Mac Art (+ 266 A. D.) suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation, Snndycove and Dublin), at first no bigger than a woman’s hand.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1884 with Owen Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard’s corner and Leonard’s corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield Avenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. In 1886 occusionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon s house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom’s) house in Lombard street, west.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination ?"

To knock or not to knock.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloom’s decision ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement, and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he fall ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By his body’s known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Froedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the"

Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen’s mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation. The second in the cofferoom of Breslin’s hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen’s father and Stephen’s granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older."
633,633,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O’Dowd of 54 Prussia street where during parts of the years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low’s place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles, equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round precipitous globe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositious wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness : the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception,"
634,634,2,1,"her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The indoor exercices, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow’s Physical Strength and How To Obtain It which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had any special agility been his in earlier youth ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in his stable and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did either openly allude to their racial difference ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts about Stephen’s thoughts about Bloom about Stephen’s thoughts about Bloom’s thoughts about Stephen ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolf Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty). Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier)."

A. alone in the protestant church of Saint Nicolas Without, Coombe, by James O’Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords, and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone, C. C. alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did they find their educational careers similar ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame’s school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts second arts and arts degree courses of the royal university.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What two temperaments did they individually represent ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientific. The artistic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary, for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve"

637,637,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;success ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She sits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks. On solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs. Wheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He seizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight.

Queen's hotel Queen’s Ho...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen’s Hotel, Ennis, County Clare where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment, composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10. 20 a. m. on the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at 3. 15 p. m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid), the toxin aforesaid, at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Coincidence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He preferred himself to see another’s face and listen to another’s words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved."
638,638,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of the Plums ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (e. g. My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogie themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon’s Studies in Blue, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlicet, Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise, 3.33 a. m., sunset 8.29 p. m.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What to do with our wives.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What had been his hypothetical singular solutions ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spilikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon) : embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society : musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano : legal scrivenery or envelope addressing : biweekly visits to variety entertainments : commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan : the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled : social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity : courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution ?"
639,639,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both : metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), alias (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred Scripture).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How had he attemped to remedy this state of comparative ignorance ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page : by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge : by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other’s ignorant lapse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With what success had he attempted direct instruction ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest, comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What system had proved more effective ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indirect suggestion implicating self-interest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat."
640,640,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepting the analogy implied in his guest’s parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of Adore Nebukim (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What fragment of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to host and by host to guest?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Stephen : suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus suil go cuin (walk,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Bloom : Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch (thy temple amid<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made in substantiation of the oral comparison ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the penultimate blank page of a book entituled of inferior literary style, Sweets of Sin (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted goph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1, 4 and 100."
641,641,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoretical* being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages : their antiquity, both having taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland : their archeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homilectic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara) Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells : their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival : the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S. Mary’s Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve’s tavern) : the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and jewish dress acts : the restoration in Chanan David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, ethnically irreducible consummation ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kolod balejwaw pnimah Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By a periphrastic version of the general text.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what common study did their mutual reflections merge ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic)."
642,642,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the guest comply with his host’s request?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was Stephen's auditive sensation ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was Bloom’s visual sensation ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were Stephen’s and Bloom’s quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Visually, Stephen’s : The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Auditively, Bloom's : The Traditionnal accent af the ecstasy of catastrophe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the church, Roman, Anglican, or Nonconformist : exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.J., the reverend T. Salmon, D.D., provost of Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish : exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K. C., Rufus Isaacs, K. C. On the stage, modern or Shakespearean : examplars Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle (+ 1901), exponent of Shakespeare.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;legend on an allied theme ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reassuringly, their place where none could hear them talk being secluded,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a mechanacal mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consumed."
643,643,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played He drove it ow'er the je's garden wall.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played He broke the jew's windows all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window."

Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew’s daughter, all dressed in green."
645,645,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condense Stephen’s commentary.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of all the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by inadvertence, twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth, holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was the host (victim predestined) sad ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was the host (secret infidel) silent ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder : the incitation of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From hypnotic suggestion : once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment : more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable ofmovingor uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated, in night attire had lain, sleeping.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twice, in Holies street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression."
646,646,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What other infantile memories had he of her ?<br>15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox : counted his three free moneypenny buttons one, tloo, tlee : a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away : blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, ahallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What endemic characteristics were present ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to its most distant intervals.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What memories had he of her adolescence ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's lawn entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15 th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A temporary departure of his cat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why similarly, why differently ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other respects were their differences similar ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness."
647,647,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf. neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen’s green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf. mousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf. earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf. hearthdreaming cat). Hence, in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, were differences were similar.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way had he utilised gifts 1) an owl, 2) a clock), given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As object lessons to explain : 1) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation : 2) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions clockwise of moveable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour, when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, videlicet, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what manners did she reciprocate ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remembered : on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown Derby porcelain ware. She provided : at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired : a natural phenomenon having been explained by him not for her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part."
648,648,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediateiy adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolungation of such extemporisation ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the guest : security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the hostess : disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew’s daughter ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Goulding, 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the proposal of asylum accepted ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What exchange of money took place between host and guest ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (£ 1-7-0), one pound seven shilling, advanced by the latter to the former."
649,649,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place) the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holies street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places).<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The irreparability of the past : once at a performance of Albert Hengler’s circus in the Rotunda, Rutland Square, Dublin, anintuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown’s) papa. The imprevidibility of the future : once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2/-) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the clown Bloom’s son ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had Bloom’s coin returned ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity."
650,650,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole; the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance; the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death : the monotonous menstruation, of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause; inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics : catastrophic cataclyms which make terror the basis of human mentality : seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions : the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis, from infancy through maturity to decay.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did he desist from speculation ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did Stephen participate in his dejection?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this affimation apprehended by Bloom ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not verbally. Substantially.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What comforted his misapprehension ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighted Candle in Stick borne by Bloom<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by Stephen."

Stephen put the hat on his head.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a cat.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellation ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster : of the moon invisible in incipient lunation, approaching perigee : of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth : of Sirius ( alpha in Canis Maior) 10 lightyears (57, 000, 000, 000, 000, miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet : of Arcturus : of the precession of equinoxes : of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained : of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901 : of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules : of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threscore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth : of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa : of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single"
652,652,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pinhead : of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e. g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he find the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and statosphere was approximated, from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution, he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms wiih finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and to all that is vanity."
653,653,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the problem of possible redemption ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The minor was proved by the major.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar) : their degrees of brilliancy : their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th : their positions : the waggoner s star : Walsingham way : the chariot of David : the annular cinctures of Saturn : the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns : the interdependant gyrations of double suns : the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle : the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution : the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion : the sidereal origin of meteoric stones : the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger satroscopist : the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10 August) : the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms : the posited influence of celestial on human bodies : the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and dissapeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons, the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistance of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings."
654,654,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His (Bloom’s) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown : an infinity, renderable equally finite by the suppositious probable apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes : a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air : a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its spectators had entered actual present existence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy : the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations : her nocturnal predominance : her satellitic dependence : her luminary reflection : her constancy under all her phases, rising, and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning : the forced invariability of her aspect : her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation : her potency over effluent and refluent waters : her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency : the tranquil inscrutability of her visage : the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity : her omens of tempest and of calm : the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence : the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence : her splendour, when visible : her attraction, when invisible."
655,655,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom’s, who attracted Stephen's<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gaze ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O’Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations : with subdued affection and admiration : with description ; with impediment; with suggestion.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both then were silent ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were they indefinitely inactive ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Stephen’s suggestion, at Bloom’s instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom’s, then Stephen’s, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar : Bloom’s longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars : Stephen’s higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vescical pressure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other ?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Bloom. : the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pelosity. To Stephen : the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1st January, holiday of obligation to hear mass"
