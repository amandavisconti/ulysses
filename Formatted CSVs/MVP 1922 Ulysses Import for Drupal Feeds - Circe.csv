408,408,2,1,"(The Mabbot street entrance of nighttown, before which stretches an uncobbled tramsiding set with skeleton tracks, red and green will-o’-the wisps and danger signals. Rows of flimsy houses with gaping doors. Rare lamps with faint rainbow fans. Round Rabaiotti's halted ice gondola stunted men and women squabble. They grab wafers between which are wedged lumps of coal and copper snow. Sucking, they scatter slowly. Children. The swancomb of the gondola, highreared, forges on through the murk, white and blue under a lighthouse. Whistles call and answer.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE CALLS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, my love, and Til be with you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE ANSWERS<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Round behind the stable.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A deafmute idiot with goggle eyes, his shapeless mouth dribbling, jerks past, shaken in Saint Vitus’ dance.

A pigmy woman swings on a rope slung between the railings, counting. A form sprawled against a dustbin and muffled by its arm and hat moves, groans, grinding growling teeth, and snores again. On a step a gnome totting among a rubbishtip crouches to shoulder a sack of rags and bones. A crone standing by with a smoky oil lamp rams the last bottle in the maw of his sack. He heaves his booty, tugs askew his peaked cap and hobbles off mutely. The crone makes back for her lair swaying her lamp. A bandy child, asquat on the doorstep with a paper shuttlecock, crawls sidling after her in spurts, clutches her skirt, scrambles up. A drunken navvy grips with both hands the railings of an area, lurching heavily. At a corner two night watch in shoulder capes, their hands upon their staffholsters, loom tall. A plate crashes; a woman screams; a child wails. Oaths of a man roar, mutter, cease. Figures wander, lurk, peer from warrens. In a room lit by a candle stuck in a bottleneck a slut combs out the tatts from the hair of a scrufulous child.

The navvy staggering forward cleaves the crowd and lurches towards the tramsiding. On the farther side under the railway bridge Bloom appears flushed, panting, cramming bread and chocolate into a side pocket.

Then bending to one side he presses a parcel against his rib and groans.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BLOOM<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stitch in my side.

The jarvey joins in the mute pantomimic merriment nodding from the farther seat. Bloom shakes his head in mute mirthful reply. With thumb and palm Corny Kelleher reassures that the two bobbies will allow the sleep to continue for what else is to be done. With a slow",

Bloom with his hand assuralooms Corny Kelleher that he is reassuraloomtay. The tinkling hoofs and jingling harness grow fainter with their tooralooloo looloo lay. Bloom, holding in his hand Stephen's hat festooned with shavings and ashplant, stands irresolute. Then he bends to him and shakes him by the shoulder.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BLOOM<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eh! Ho! (There is no answer; he bends again.) Mr Dedalus! (There is no answer.) The name if you call. Somnambulist. (He bends again and, hesitating, brings his mouth near the face of the prostrate form.) Stephen! (There is no answer. He calls again.) Stephen!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEPHEN<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Groans.) Who? Black panther vampire. (He sighs and stretches himself, then murmurs thickly with prolonged vowels.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who... drive... Fergus now.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And pierce... wood’s woven shade?...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(He turns on his left side, sighing, doubling himself together.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BLOOM<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poetry. Well educated. Pity. (He bends again and undoes the buttons of Stephen's waistcoat.) To breathe. (He brushes the woodshavings from Stephen's clothes with light hands and fingers.) One pound seven. Not hurt anyhow. (He listens.) What!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;STEPHEN<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Murmurs.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...shadows... the woods.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...white breast... dim...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(He stretches out his arms, sighs again and curls his body. Bloom holding his hat and ashplant stands erect. A dog barks in the distance. Bloom tightens and loosens his grip on the ashplant. He looks down on Stephen’s face and form.)",

Some girl. Best thing could happen him... (He murmurs.)... swear that I will always hail, ever conceal, never reveal, any part or parts, art or arts... (He murmurs.)... in the rough sands of the sea... a cabletow’s length from the shore... where the tide ebbs... and flows...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Silent, thoughtful, alert, he stands on guard, his fingers at his lips in the attitude of secret master. Against the dark wall a figure appears slowly, a fairy boy of eleven, a changeling, kidnapped, dressed in an Eton suit with glass shoes and a little bronze helmet, holding a book in his hand. He reads from right to left inaudibly, smiling, kissing the<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; page.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BLOOM<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Wonderstruck, calls inaudibly.) Rudy!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RUDY<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Gazes unseeing into Bloom's eyes and goes on reading, kissing, smiling. He has a delicate mauve face. On his suit he has diamond and ruby buttons. In his free left hand he holds a slim ivory cane with a violet bowknot. A white lambskin peeps out of his waistcoat pocket.)",
