Where? gold asked more eagerly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— In the second carriage, Miss Douce’s wet lips said, laughing in the sun. He’s looking. Mind till I see.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She darted, bronze, to the backmost corner, flattening her face against the pane in a halo of hurried breath.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her wet lips tittered:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— He’s killed looking back.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She laughed:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— O wept! Aren’t men frightful idiots?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sadness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Kennedy sauntered sadly from bright light, twining a loose hair behind an ear. Sauntering sadly, gold no more, she twisted twined a hair. Sadly she twined in sauntering gold hair behind a curving ear.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— It’s them has the fine times, sadly then she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A man.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloowho went by by Moulang’s pipes, bearing in his breast the sweets of sin, by Wine’s antiques in memory bearing sweet sinful words, by Carroll’s dusky battered plate, for Raoul.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boots to them, them in the bar, them barmaids came. For them unheeding him he banged on the counter his tray of chattering china. And<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— There’s your teas, he said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Kennedy with manners transposed the teatray down to an upturned lithia crate, safe from eyes, low.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— What is it? loud boots unmannerly asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Find out, Miss Douce retorted, leaving her spyingpoint.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Your beau, is it?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A haughty bronze replied:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— I’ll complain to Mrs de Massey on you if I hear any more of your impertinent insolence.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Imperthnthn thnthnthn, bootsnout sniffed rudely, as he retreated as she threatened as he had come."
248,248,2,1,"Bloom.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On her flower frowning Miss Douce said:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Most aggravating that young brat is. If he doesn’t conduct himself I'll wring his ear for him a yard long.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ladylike in exquisite contrast.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Take no notice, Miss Kennedy rejoined.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She poured in a teacup tea, then back in the teapot tea. They cowered under their reef of counter, waiting on footstools, crates upturned, waiting for their teas to draw. They pawed their blouses, both of black satin, two and nine a yard, waiting for their teas to draw, and two and seven.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, bronze from anear, by gold from afar, heard steel from anear, hoofs ring from afar, and heard steelhoofs ringhoof ringsteel.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Am I awfully sunburnt?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss bronze unbloused her neck.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— No, said Miss Kennedy. It gets brown after. Did you try the borax with the cherry laurel water?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Douce halfstood to see her skin askance in the barmirror gildedlettered where hock and claret glasses shimmered and in their midst a shell.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— And leave it to my hands, she said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Try it with the glycerine, Miss Kennedy advised.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bidding her neck and hands adieu Miss Douce<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Those things only bring out a rash, replied, reseated. I asked that old fogey in Boyd’s for something for my skin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Kennedy, pouring now fulldrawn tea, grimaced and prayed:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— O, don’t remind me of him for mercy’sake!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— But wait till I tell you, Miss Douce entreated.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet tea Miss Kennedy having poured with milk plugged both two ears with little fingers.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— No, don’t, she cried.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— I won’t listen, she cried.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bloom?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Douce grunted in snuffy fogey’s tone:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— For your what? says he.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Kennedy unplugged her ears to hear, to speak : but said, but prayed again:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Don’t let me think of him or I’ll expire. The hideous old wretch! That night in the Antient Concert Rooms,"
249,249,2,1,"She sipped distastefully her brew, hot tea, a sip, sipped sweet tea.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Here he was, Miss Douce said, cocking her bronze head three quarters, ruffling her nosewings. Hufa! Hufa!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrill shriek of laughter sprang from Miss Kennedy’s throat. Miss Douce huffed and snorted down her nostrils that quivered imperthnthn like a shout in quest.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— O! shrieking, Miss Kennedy cried. Will you ever forget his goggle eye?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Douce chimed in in deep bronze laughter, shouting:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— And your other eye!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloowhose dark eye read Aaron Figatner’s name. Why do I always think Figather? Gathering figs I think. And Prosper Loré’s huguenot name. By Bassi’s blessed virgins Bloom’s dark eyes went by. Bluerobed, white under, come to me. God they believe she is : or goddess. Those today. I could not see. That fellow spoke. A student. After with Dedalus’son. He might be Mulligan. All comely virgins. That brings those rakes of fellows in : her white.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By went his eyes. The sweets of sin. Sweet are the sweets.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of sin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a giggling peal young goldbronze voices blended, Douce with Kennedy your other eye. They threw young heads back, bronze gigglegold, to let freefly their laughter, screaming, your other, signals to each other, high piercing notes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, panting, sighing. Sighing, ah, fordone their mirth died down.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Kennedy lipped her cup again, raised, drank a sip and gigglegiggled. Miss Douce, bending again over the teatray, ruffled again her nose and rolled droll fattened eyes. Again Kennygiggles, stooping her fair pinnacles of hair, stooping, her tortoise napecomb showed, spluttered out of her mouth her tea, choking in tea and laughter, coughing with choking, crying:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— O greasy eyes! Imagine being married to a man like that, she cried. With his bit of beard!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Douce gave full vent to a splendid yell, a full yell of full woman, delight, joy, indignation.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Married to the greasy nose! she yelled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shrill, with deep laughter, after bronze in gold, they urged each each to peal after peal, ringing in changes, bronzegold goldbronze, shrilldeep, to laughter after laughter. And then laughed more. Greasy I knows. Exhausted, breathless their shaken heads they laid, braided and pinnacled by glossycombed, against the counterledge. All flushed (O!), panting, sweating (O!), all breathless. Married to Bloom, to greaseaseabloom."
250,250,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— O saints above! Miss Douce said, sighed above her jumping rose.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wished I hadn’t laughed so much. I feel all wet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— O, Miss Douce! Miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And flushed yet more (you horrid!), more goldenly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Cantwell’s offices roved Greaseabloom, by Ceppi’s virgins, bright of their oils. Nannetti’s father hawked those things about, wheedling at doors as I. Religion pays. Must see him about Keyes’s par. Eat first. I want. Not yet. At four, she said. Time ever passing. Clockhands turning. On. Where eat? The Clarence, Dolphin. On. For Raoul. Eat. If I net five guineas with those ads. The violet silk petticoats. Not yet. The sweets of sin.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flushed less, still less, goldenly paled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into their bar strolled Mr Dedalus. Chips, picking chips off one of his rocky thumbnails. Chips. He strolled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— O welcome back, Miss Douce.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held her hand. Enjoyed her holidays?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Tiptop.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hoped she had nice weather in Rostrevor.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Gorgeous, she said. Look at the holy show I am. Lying out on the strand all day.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bronze whiteness.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— That was exceedingly naughty of you, Mr Dedalus told her and pressed her hand indulgently. Tempting poor simple males.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Douce of satin douced her arm away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— O go away, she said. You’re very simple, I don’t think.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Well now, I am, he mused. I looked so simple in the cradle they christened me simple Simon.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— You must have been a doaty, Miss Douce made answer. And what did the doctor order today?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Well now, he mused, whatever you say yourself. I think I’ll trouble you for some fresh water and a half glass of whisky.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— With the greatest alacrity, Miss Douce agreed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With grace of alacrity towards the mirror gilt Cantrell and Cochrane’s she turned herself. With grace she tapped a measure of gold whisky from her crystal keg. Forth from the skirt of his coat Mr Dedalus brought pouch and pipe. Alacrity she served. He blew through the flue two husky fifenotes."
251,251,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— By Jove, he mused. I often wanted to see the Mourne moutains. Must be a great tonic in the air down there. But a long threatening comes at last, they say. Yes, yes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. He fingered shreds of hair, her maidenhair, her mermaid’s, into the bowl. Chips. Shreds. Musing. Mute.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None not said nothing. Yes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gaily Miss Douce polished a tumbler, trilling:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— O, Idolores, queen of the eastern seas <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Was Mr Lidwell in today?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In came Lenehan, Round him peered Lenehan. Mr Bloom reached Essex bridge. Yes, Mr Bloom crossed bridge of Yessex. To Martha I must write. Buy paper. Daly’s. Girl there civil. Bloom. Old Bloom. Blue Bloom is on the rye.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— He was in at lunchtime, Miss Douce said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenehan came forward.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Was Mr Boylan looking for me?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He asked. She answered:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Miss Kennedy, was Mr Boylan in while I was upstairs?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She asked. Miss voice of Kennedy answered, a second teacup poised, her gaze upon a page.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— No. He was not.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss gaze of Kennedy, heard not seen, read on. Lenehan round the sandwichbell wound his round body round.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Peep! Who’s in the corner?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No glance of Kennedy rewarding him he yet made overtures. To mind her stops. To read only the black ones : round o and crooked ess.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingle jaunty jingle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Girlgold she read and did not glance. Take no notice. She took no notice while he read by rote a solfa fable for her, plappering flatly:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Ah fox met ah stork. Said thee fox too thee stork : Will you put your bill down inn my troath and pull upp ah bone?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He droned in vain. Miss Douce turned to her tea aside.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed, aside:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Ah me! O my!<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He greeted Mr Dedalus and got a nod.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Greetings from the famous son of a famous father.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Who may he be? Mr Dedalus asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenehan opened most genial arms. Who?"
252,252,2,1,"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Who may he be? he asked. Can you ask? Stephen, the youthful bard.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dry.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Dedalus, famous father, laid by his dry filled pipe.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— I see, he said. I didn’t recognise him for the moment. I hear he is keeping very select company. Have you seen him lately?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— I quaffed the nectarbowl with him this very day, said Lenehan. In Mooney’s en ville and in Mooney’s sur mer. He had received the rhino for the labour of his muse.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled at bronze’s teabathed lips, at listening lips and eyes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— The élite of Erin hung upon his lips. The ponderous pundit. Hugh MacHugh, Dublin’s most brilliant scribe and editor and that minstrel boy of the wild wet west who is known by the euphonious appellation of the O’Madden Burke.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an interval Mr Dedalus raised his grog and<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— That must have been highly diverting, said he. I see.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He see. He drank. With faraway mourning mountain eye. Set down his glass.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked towards the saloon door.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— I see you have moved the piano.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— The tuner was in today, Miss Douce replied, tuning it for the smoking concert and I never heard such an exquisite player.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Is that a fact?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Didn’t he, Miss Kennedy? The real classical, you know. And blind too, poor fellow. Not twenty I’m sure he was.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Is that a fact? Mr Dedalus said.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drank and strayed away.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— So sad to look at his face, Miss Douce condoled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God’s curse on bitch’s bastard.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tink to her pity cried a diner’s bell. To the door of the diningroom came bald Pat, came bothered Pat, came Pat, waiter of Ormond. Lager for diner. Lager without alacrity she served.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With patience Lenehan waited for Boylan with impatience, for jingle jaunty blazes boy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upholding the lid he (who?) gazed in the coffin (coffin?) at the oblique triple (piano!) wires. He pressed (the same who pressed indulgently her hand), soft pedalling a triple of keys to sees the thicknesses of felt advancing, to hear the muffled hammerfall in action."
253,253,2,1,"Two sheets cream vellum paper one reserve two envelopes when I was in Wisdom Hely's wise Bloom in Daly’s Henry Flower bought. Are you not happy in your home? Flower to console me and a pin cuts lo. Means something, language of flow. Was it a daisy? Innocence that is. Respectable girl meet after mass. Tanks awfully muchly. Wise Bloom eyed on the door a poster, a swaying mermaid smoking mid nice waves. Smoke mermaids, coolest whiff of all. Hair streaming : lovelorn. For some man. For Raoul. He eyed and saw afar on Essex bridge a gay hat riding on a jauntingcar. It is. Third time.

Longer in dying call.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pat paid for diner’s popcorked bottle : and over tumbler tray and popcorked bottle ere he went he whispered, bald and bothered, with Miss Douce.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— The bright stars fade...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voiceless song sang from within, singing:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— ... the morn is breaking.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A duodene of birdnotes chirruped bright treble answer under sensitive hands. Brightly the keys, all twinkling, linked, all harpsichording, called to a voice to sing the strain of dewy morn, of youth, of love’s leavetaking, life’s, love’s morn.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— The dewdrops pearl...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lenehan’s lips over the counter lisped a low whistle of decoy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— But look this way, he said, rose of Castile.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jingle jaunted by the curb and stopped.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She rose and closed her reading, rose of Castile. Fretted forlorn, dreamily<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rose.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Did she fall or was she pushed? he asked her.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She answered, slighting:"

See me he might. The seat he sat on : warm. Black wary hecat walked towards Richie Goulding’s legal bag, lifted aloft saluting.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— And I from thee...<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— I heard you were round, said Blazes Boylan.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He touched to fair Miss Kennedy a rim of his slanted straw. She smiled on him. But sister bronze outsmiled her, preening for him her richer hair, a bosom and a rose.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boylan bespoke potions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— What’s your cry? Glass of bitter? Glass of bitter, please, and a sloegin for me. Wire in yet?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not yet. At four he.

Dinner fit for a prince.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Douce reached high to take a flagon, stretching her satin arm, her bust, that all but burst, so high.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— O!

Clock clacked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Douce took Boylan’s coin, struck boldly the cashregister. It clanged. Clock clacked. Fair one of Egypt teased and sorted in the till and hummed and handed coins in change. Look to the west. A clack.

Threw herself back across the bed, screaming, kicking. With all his belongings on show. O, saints above, I’m drenched! O, the women in the front row! O, I never laughed so many! Well, of course, that’s what gives him the base barreltone. For instance eunuchs. Wonder who’s playing. Nice touch. Must be Cowley. Musical. Knows whatever note you play.

Never.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenderly Bloom over liverless bacon saw the tightened features strain. Backache he. Bright’s bright eye. Next item on the programme. Paying the piper. Pills, pounded bread, worth a guinea a box. Stave it off awhile. Sings too : Down among the dead men. Appropriate. Kidney pie. Sweets to the. Not making much hand of it. Best value in. Characteristic of him. Power. Particular about his drink. Flaw in the glass, fresh Vartry water. Fecking matches from counters to save. Then squander a sovereign in dribs and drabs.

Blackbird I heard in the hawthorn valley. Taking my motives he twined and turned them. All most too new call is lost in all. Echo. How sweet the answer. How is that done? All lost now. Mournful he whistled. Fall, surrender, lost.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloom bent leopold ear, turning a fringe of doyley down under the vase. Order. Yes, I remember. Lovely air.

Bless me and let me go.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bloom looked, unblessed to go. Got up to kill : on eighteen bob a week. Fellows shell out the dibs. Want to keep your weathereye open. Those girls, those lovely. By the sad sea waves. Chorusgirl’s romance. Letters read out for breach of promise. From Chickabiddy’s own Mumpsypum. Laughter in court. Henry. I never signed it. The lovely name you.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low sank the music, air and words. Then hastened. The false priest rustling soldier from his cassock. A yeoman captain. They know it all by heart. The thrill they itch for. Yeoman cap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tap. Tap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrilled, she listened, bending in sympathy to hear.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blank face. Virgin should say : or fingered only. Write something on it : page. If not what becomes of them? Decline, despair. Keeps them young. Even admire themselves. See. Play on her. Lip blow. Body of white woman, a flute alive. Blow gentle. Loud. Three holes all women. Goddess I didn’t see."
274,274,2,1,"They want it : not too much polite. That’s why he gets them. Gold in your pocket, brass in your face. With look to look : songs without words. Molly that hurdygurdy boy. She knew he meant the monkey was sick. Or because so like the Spanish. Understand animals too that way. Solomon did. Gift of nature.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ventriloquise. My lips closed. Think in my stom. What?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will? You? I. Want. You. To.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hoarse rude fury the yeoman cursed. Swelling in apoplectic bitch’s bastard. A good thought, boy, to come. One hour’s your time to live, your last.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tap. Tap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thrill now. Pity they feel. To wipe away a tear for martyrs. For all things dying, want to, dying to, die. For that all things born. Poor Mrs Purefoy. Hope she’s over. Because their wombs.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A liquid of womb of woman eyeball gazed under a fence of lashes, calmly, hearing. See real beauty of the eye when she not speaks. On yonder river. At each slow satiny heaving bosom’s wave (her heaving embon) red rose rose slowly, sank red rose. Heartbeats her breath : breath that is life. And all the tiny tiny fernfoils trembled of maidenhair.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But look. The bright stars fade. O rose! Castile. The morn. Ha. Lidwell. For him then not for. Infatuated. I like that? See her from here though. Popped corks, splashes of beerfroth, stacks of empties.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the smooth jutting beerpull laid Lydia hand lightly, plumply, leave it to my hands. All lost in pity for croppy. Fro, to : to, fro : over the polished knob (she knows his eyes, my eyes, her eyes) her thumb and finger passed in pity : passed, repassed and, gently touching, then slid so smoothly, slowly down, a cool firm white enamel baton protruding through their sliding ring.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a cock with a carra.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tap. Tap. Tap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hold this house. Amen. He gnashed in fury. Traitors swing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chords consented. Very sad thing. But had to be.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get out before the end. Thanks, that was heavenly. Where’s my hat. Pass by her. Can leave that Freeman. Letter I have. Suppose she were the? No. Walk, walk, walk. Like Cashel Boylo Connoro Coylo Tisdall Maurice Tisntdall Farrell. Waaaaaaalk.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I must be. Are you off? Yrfmstbyes. Blmstup. O’er ryehigh blue. Bloom stood up. Ow. Soap feeling rather sticky behind. Must have sweated : music That lotion, remember. Well, so long. High grade. Card inside, yes."
275,275,2,1,"By deaf Pat in the doorway, straining ear, Bloom passed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Geneva barrack that young man died. At Passage was his body laid. Dolor! O, he dolores! The voice of the mournful chanter called to dolorous prayer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By rose, by satiny bosom, by the fondling hand, by slops, by empties, by popped corks, greeting in going, past eyes and maidenhair, bronze and faint gold in deepseashadow, went Bloom, soft Bloom, I feel so lonely Bloom.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tap. Tap. Tap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pray for him, prayed the bass of Dollard. You who hear in peace. Breathe a prayer, drop a tear, good men, good people. He was the croppy boy.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scaring eavesdropping boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway heard growls and roars of bravo, fat blackslapping, their boots all treading, boots not the boots the boy. General chorus off for a swill to wash it down. Glad I avoided.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Come on, Ben, Simon Dedalus said. By God, you’re as good as ever you were.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Better, said Tomgin Kernan. Most trenchant rendition of that ballad, upon my soul and honour it is.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Lablache, said Father Cowley.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ben Dollard bulkily cachuchad towards the bar, mightily praisefed and all big roseate, on heavyfooted feet, his gouty fingers nakkering castagnettes in the air.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big Benaben Dollard.

Fit as a fiddle only he has a lot of adipose tissue concealed about his person.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rrrrrrsss.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Fat of death, Simon, Ben Dollard growled.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Richie rift in the lute alone sat : Goulding, Collis, Ward. Uncertainly he waited. Unpaid Pat too.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tap. Tap. Tap. Tap.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Mina Kennedy brought near her lips to ear of tankard one.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Mr Dollard, they murmured low."

The name was familiar to him, that is to say. That was to say he had heard the name of Dollard, was it? Dollard, yes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, her lips said more loudly, Mr Dollard. He sang that song lovely, murmured Mina. And The last rose of summer was a lovely song. Mina loved that song. Tankard loved the song that Mina.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’Tis the last rose of summer dollard left Bloom felt wind wound round inside.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gassy thing that cider : binding too.

Better give way only half way the way of a man with a maid. Instance enthusiasts. All ears. Not lose a demisemiquaver. Eyes shut. Head nodding in time. Dotty. You daren’t budge. Thinking strictly prohibited. Always talking shop. Fiddlefaddle about notes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All a kind of attempt to talk. Unpleasant when it stops because you never know exac. Organ in Gardiner street. Old Glynn fifty quid a year. Queer up there in the cockloft alone with stops and locks and keys.

A wee little wind piped eeee. In Bloom’s little wee.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— Was he? Mr Dedalus said, returning, with fetched pipe.

Piles of parchment. Messrs Pick and Pocket have power of attorney. Goulding, Collis, Ward.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for example the chap that wallops the big drum. His vocation : Micky Rooney’s band. Wonder how it first struck him. Sitting at home after pig’s cheek and cabbage nursing it in the armchair. Rehearsing his band part. Pom. Pompedy. Jolly for the wife. Asses’ skins. Welt them through life, then wallop after death. Pom. Wallop. Seems to be what you call yashmak or I mean kismet. Fate.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tap.

278,278,2,1,"It is music, I mean of course it’s all pom pom pom very much what they call da capo. Still you can hear. As we march, we march along, march along.
