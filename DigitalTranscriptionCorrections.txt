#Corrections 
Corrections I made to the current Modernist Versions Project transcription (TXT) after comparison with the MVP digital images of the text:

+ Page 1: Substituted "Chrysostomos" for "Chryspstomos" (rectifying transcription error).

+ Page 18: "mother s" for "mother's"

+ Page 24: "Cochrane's" for "Gochrane's"

+ Page 25: "Weaver" for "Wearer"

+ Page 27: "Fultility." for "Futility"

+ Page 31: "Dublin." for "Dublin ."

*These will be updated as I continue proofing the text. I've currently done an informal proofing of episodes 1 and 2.*
